My doctoral thesis, *The Empire Types Back: Colonialism and Resistance in forms of Storytelling Online*, is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, blending sociological research and literary studies with development and cultural studies. Specifically, my work considers how marginalised voices find expression through technology-facilitated creativity and novel forms of work on digital storytelling platforms and digital heritage platforms in India. Building on literary postcolonial theory and texts such as Gayatri Chakraborty Spivak’s seminal work, Can the Subaltern Speak?, my work considers the impact of digital media on Indian readers and writers. 

Beyond my thesis, I have worked on numerous research projects, establishing my reputation as an interdisciplinary researcher with a variety of high-profile partners. I have collaborated with researchers from high-profile institutions such as LSE, Stanford University, King’s College London, the University of Cambridge, University of Northumbria, and University of the Arts London.  My research has reached a variety of prominent venues, both academic and public: I have been quoted by, written for, and contributed to The Telegraph, The Independent, Rest of World and El País. I have been awarded grants and awards from the Minderoo Foundation, the OII, the British Council, the Oxford Research Centre for the Humanities (TORCH), Stanford University, and Balliol College, testifying to my ability to secure competitive research funding.
