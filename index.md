<p>
  Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a (soon-to-be completed) DPhil candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute researching purpose-built storytelling platforms in India and the changing nature of writing online. I am looking for academic and academic-adjacent roles in the intersection of technology, media, and society. Please feel free to reach out to me via email, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
